# Role Icon Recolors Blank Template

### By MysticMismagius

This is a template for @AlchlcDvl's [Role Icon Recolors](https://github.com/AlchlcDvl/RoleIconRecolors) mod for Town of Salem 2. Use this to craft your own beautiful icon packs, and for mod debugging purposes. All icons compatible with the mod are included and properly named (I hope).

This was originally a part of the [Community Recolors](https://github.com/Nidoskull/CommunityRecolors) collaboration heralded by @Nidoskull. @AlchlcDvl has recently asked me to create a separate repository for the blank template.

# Color Guide

For all roles and factions with their own color, the Ã˜ symbol is the same color or gradient as the role/faction. Other categories are colored as follows:

- Frogs: blue Splatoon 3 Splatfest logo
- Hawks: red Splatoon 3 Splatfest logo
- Lions: yellow Splatoon 3 Splatfest logo
- Cursed Soul: uses BTOS2's color gradient (mint green -> dark purple)
- Custom: rainbow gradient
- Factionless: white
- Necronomicon: purple -> pink
- Regular: black
- VIP: green -> yellow
- PlayerColors: Each have a differently colored Splatoon 3 Splatfest logo.

Base icons have a brown background, and Easter Eggs have a gray background.

# Guide to Icon Pack Creation

## Easter Eggs
An icon may have one or more easter eggs. If there are multiple easter eggs add them in this format: `XX_IconY` <br>
Where XX is the name of the icon and Y is the number of easter eggs starting at 0.

## BToS2/Vanilla Icon Separation

Some ability icons are different based on which version of the game (vanilla or btos) is being played. These icons are:
  - Admirer_Ability_BTOS2
  - Admirer_Ability_Vanilla
  - Admirer_Special_Vanilla
  - Baker_Ability_1_BTOS2
  - Baker_Ability_2_BTOS2
  - Baker_Ability_Vanilla
  - Baker_Special_BTOS2
  - Deputy_Special_Vanilla
  - Deputy_Ability_BTOS2
  - Deputy_Special_BTOS2
  - Illusionist_Special_BTOS2

Other icons can use this format if you want unique icons for vanilla and BToS2, but only the above icons require it to be complete.
