# Community Recolors
Community-made Role Icon Recolors for Town of Salem 2. This GitHub repo was made to replace the Google Drive that previously held the icons.
This repo is built to work with @AlchlcDvl's [Role Icon Recolors](https://github.com/AlchlcDvl/RoleIconRecolors) mod for Town of Salem 2 out-of-the-box. Just set it as your recolor folder through the in-game GitHub download method, and go!
